Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are critical inputs for advanced manufacturing,
including electric motors, precision guidance systems, renewable energy
infrastructure, and consumer electronics.

While REEs are geologically widespread, economically viable extraction,
separation, and refining are highly concentrated. China dominates global
REE processing and refining capacity, particularly for neodymium and
praseodymium used in high-performance permanent magnets.

India possesses limited REE reserves and minimal downstream refining
capability, relying heavily on imports for both raw materials and
finished magnet components. Efforts to diversify supply have been slow
due to environmental concerns, capital intensity, and technological barriers.

Global REE supply chains are politically sensitive, opaque, and prone to
state intervention.
