# Centaur Project

![Centaur Concept](images/logo-L.jpg)

## Overview

**Centaur** is a research and development project exploring **human–machine symbiosis**: systems where human cognition and machine intelligence operate as a coupled, adaptive whole rather than as tools and users.

The project treats intelligence as **hybrid**, **contextual**, and **embodied**—emerging from interaction between biological agency, computational systems, and physical or informational environments.

Centaur is not about automation replacing humans.  
It is about **augmentation, co-agency, and alignment at the level of cognition**.

## Core Ideas

- **Human-in-the-loop intelligence**  
  Machines amplify judgment, pattern recognition, and memory without erasing human intent.

- **Cognitive leverage, not substitution**  
  The goal is to increase decision quality, range, and resilience—not speed alone.

- **System-level thinking**  
  Intelligence is treated as a property of *systems*, not isolated components.

- **Interpretability and control**  
  Centaur systems privilege transparency, reversibility, and human override.

## Scope

Depending on implementation phase, Centaur may include:

- Hybrid decision-support architectures  
- AI-assisted sensemaking and synthesis tools  
- Human–machine interfaces (textual, visual, symbolic)  
- Simulation and scenario modeling frameworks  
- Governance, ethics, and control primitives for augmented intelligence
