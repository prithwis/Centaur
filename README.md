# Centaur  
### A Strategic Simulation Playground

Centaur is an [experimental playground](https://github.com/prithwis/Centaur/tree/main/documents) for thinking about strategy, uncertainty, and complex worlds — with a little help from humans, machines, and chance.

It sits somewhere between:
- a strategy game,
- a thought experiment,
- and a long conversation with an opinionated advisor.

It is **not** a predictor, an optimizer, or a serious model of the world.  
It is, first and foremost, a **pastime**.

## What Is This?

Centaur explores questions like:
- *What happens if you take this action in a messy world?*
- *How do different perspectives frame the same situation?*
- *How much of strategy is judgment, and how much is luck?*

The system mixes:
- human choices,
- AI-generated perspectives,
- and controlled randomness

…to see what kind of stories and consequences emerge.

## How It’s Meant to Be Used

Think of Centaur as a **sandbox**.

You define a world, make some moves, react to what happens, and repeat.  
Sometimes the outcome is clever.  
Sometimes it’s surprising.  
Sometimes it’s just amusing.

There is no “winning.”
There is no “correct” strategy.
There is only *what followed from what you did*.

---

## What It Is *Not*

Centaur does **not**:
- forecast the real world
- give policy advice
- claim objectivity
- promise accuracy

If you’re looking for answers, this is the wrong place.  
If you’re looking for **better questions**, you’re in the right one.

## Why “Centaur”?

Because the project lives in the middle:
- part human judgment,
- part machine reasoning.

Neither is in charge.
Both are incomplete.
That’s the point.

## Status

This is a living experiment.

Names may change.  
Rules may change.  
Structure may change.

That’s not a bug — it’s the design.
